The difference between `return function()` and `function()` in recursion lies in **what happens to the returned value of the recursive function call** and **how it affects the execution flow**. Here's a detailed explanation:

### 1. **Using `return function()`**
   - When you use `return function()`, the value returned by the recursive call is propagated back to the caller.
   - This approach ensures that the final result of the recursion is passed back up through all the recursive calls.

   **Example: Factorial Calculation**
   ```python
   def factorial(n):
       if n == 1:
           return 1
       return n * factorial(n - 1)
   
   print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
   ```
   - Here, `factorial(n - 1)` is **returned**, so each call waits for the value from the next recursive call.
   - The flow would be:
     - `factorial(5)` waits for `factorial(4)`
     - `factorial(4)` waits for `factorial(3)`, and so on, until `factorial(1)` returns `1`.

### 2. **Using `function()` (without `return`)**
   - When you simply call `function()` without `return`, the value returned by the recursive call is ignored.
   - This is useful when the recursion is used for tasks like traversal or printing, where the result of the recursive call is not needed.

   **Example: Printing a Countdown**
   ```python
   def countdown(n):
       if n == 0:
           print("Liftoff!")
           return
       print(n)
       countdown(n - 1)
   
   countdown(5)
   ```
   - Here, `countdown(n - 1)` is **not returned**, as there's no need to propagate any value up the recursive calls.
   - The flow is simple:
     - Each call to `countdown(n - 1)` is executed independently.

### Key Differences

| **Aspect**                 | **`return function()`**                           | **`function()`**                             |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Return Value Handling**  | Passes the result of the recursive call upward.  | Ignores the result of the recursive call.   |
| **Use Case**               | Used when recursion generates a value (e.g., factorial, Fibonacci). | Used when recursion performs an action (e.g., printing, traversal). |
| **Effect on Recursion Flow** | Recursive calls depend on the returned value.   | Recursive calls execute independently.      |

### Summary
- Use `return function()` if the recursive function needs to compute and return a value.
- Use `function()` if the recursive function performs an action where no value needs to be returned.
